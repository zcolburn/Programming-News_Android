# Programming News
This app download RSS feeds from numerous sources, parses that data, and displays it in a visually appealing manner. Specifically, the main screen displays a list of article titles, their corresponding sources, and corresponding publication dates. These sources can be refreshed at any time by clicking the refresh button. Clicking an article in this view will display the text encoded in the description part of the rss feed for that article. The article can also be viewed with a web view by clicking the web view button. Articles can be favorited from either article view. A list of favorited articles can be accessed via the favorites icon on the main screen. Notifications can be enabled for a particular time of day in the preferences activity, which can be accessed from the main screen. The notification reminds the user to continue learning by reading programming news articles.


# Key mechanics
The RSS feeds are downloaded and parsed asynchronously. Since downloading all entries in large RSS feeds, such as those from stackoverflow, would overwhelm the user, I limited the number of articles downloaded per source to 10. After successfully parsing the data for 10 articles, the next source is parsed. Each parsed article is inserted into a sqlite database. Duplicate entries are not permitted. Articles published more than two days earlier are removed from the database. This keeps the database size reasonable.
